Hello!

I am a Senior Researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), where I conduct work on military expenditure and arms production. I am mostly interested in the interplay between [political institutions and military spending](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10242694.2022.2129128). I also spend quite sometime thinking about how to use data to promote international disarmament.

I created this website to show some of my work and to share some pet projects of mine and a few random thoughts. In my spare time, I like reading about other topics I am interested in. Here is what I am [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67052947-diego-da-silva) at the moment.
