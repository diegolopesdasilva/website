    "text": "Hello!\nI am a Senior Researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), where I conduct work on military expenditure and arms production. I am mostly interested in the interplay between political institutions and military spending. I also spend quite sometime thinking about how to use data to promote international disarmament.\nI created this website to show some of my work but also to share some pet projects of mine, like this analysis of country statements at the United Nations First Committee or this exploration of SIPRI’s military expenditure. In my spare time, I like reading about other topics I am interested in, like philosophy, history of mathematics and a bunch of other stuff. Here is what I am reading at the moment.\nHere you can find my CV, SIPRI page, Google Scholar, GitHub and Tableau Profile.\nYou can find me on Twitter also @dielopesilva."

    "text": "Hello!\nHere is a little bit about me. I am Brazilian but I live in Sweden for almost 5 years now with my wife Ana and our little son, Bento. I have a PhD in Peace, Defense and International Security from the San Tiago Dantas Graduate Programe of the São Paulo State University in São Paulo, Brazil.\nWhile my basic scientific training was mostly qualitative, I’ve grown to love quantitative methods over the years. Besides being and interesting topic in and of itself, statistics is an extremely powerful tool - specially when combined with sound qualitative work (all my favorite papers do both!). I have also grown to love programming in R. If you ask me, R is everything science needs to be: free and collaborative. Anyone anywhere can use it and produce insights. That is amazing. Plus, you can do so many other things with it, like this website for example. While I do like to preach the word of R, I am also familiar with Stata.\nLastly, if there is one thing you should know about me is that I am curious. The reason I chose to study International Relations is because it covers so much ground. I got to study so many of the things I was passionate about, like History, Economics, Sociology and so on. However, that are so many things I am interested in beyond International Relations. The thing I read the most about is certainly Philosophy - most recently, I am obsessed with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Analytical Philosophy. But I also read a lot about the history of mathematics - being mathematical problems or biographies of mathematicians. You can check my Goodreads page to see what I have been reading."
